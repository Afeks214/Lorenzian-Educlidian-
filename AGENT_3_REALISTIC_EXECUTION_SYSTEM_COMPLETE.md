## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### NQ Futures Specifications
```python
@dataclass
class NQFuturesSpecs:
    contract_name: str = "NQ"
    point_value: float = 20.0      # $20 per point
    tick_size: float = 0.25        # 0.25 points
    tick_value: float = 5.0        # $5 per tick
    commission_per_rt: float = 0.50 # $0.50 per round turn
    initial_margin: float = 19000.0 # $19,000 per contract
    maintenance_margin: float = 17300.0 # $17,300 per contract
```

### Slippage Calculation Formula
```python
total_slippage = (
    base_slippage +                    # 0.5 pts market, 0.25 pts limit
    market_impact +                    # 0.1 pts per contract
    volatility_adjustment +            # 2x during high vol
    liquidity_adjustment              # 1.5x during off hours
) * volume_adjustment * stress_adjustment
```

### Position Sizing Algorithm
```python
def calculate_position_size(account_value, entry_price, stop_price, risk_pct):
    risk_amount = account_value * risk_pct
    risk_per_contract = abs(entry_price - stop_price) * point_value
    optimal_contracts = risk_amount / risk_per_contract
    
    # Apply constraints
    contracts = max(min_contracts, min(optimal_contracts, max_contracts))
    
    # Check margin requirements
    required_margin = contracts * initial_margin
    if required_margin > account_value * 0.8:
        contracts = adjust_for_margin(contracts, account_value)
    
    return contracts
```
