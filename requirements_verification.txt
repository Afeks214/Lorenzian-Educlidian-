# Requirements for PettingZoo Environment Verification
# These are the minimal requirements to run the verification scripts

# Core verification (no additional requirements)
# The verification scripts are designed to work with Python standard library only

# For full PettingZoo environment testing:
# pettingzoo>=1.22.0
# gymnasium>=0.28.0
# numpy>=1.21.0

# For advanced testing with ML components:
# torch>=1.12.0
# pandas>=1.3.0
# scipy>=1.7.0

# For visualization and monitoring:
# matplotlib>=3.5.0
# seaborn>=0.11.0

# Note: The verification scripts in this project are designed to work
# without these dependencies to enable testing in minimal environments.
