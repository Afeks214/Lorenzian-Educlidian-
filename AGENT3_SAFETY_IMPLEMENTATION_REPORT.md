    - **Signal Level**: `_detect_signals()` - Blocks signal detection
  - Enhanced status reporting with safety check information
  - Added `system_active` and `safety_checks` to status output

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Safety Check Pattern
```python
# Standard safety check pattern implemented across all components
kill_switch = get_kill_switch()
if kill_switch and kill_switch.is_active():
    logger.warning("Trading system is OFF - blocking [component] processing")
    return empty_results()
```

### Empty Results Structure
- **Synergy Results**: `synergy_bull=False, synergy_bear=False, synergy_strength=0.0`
- **Indicator Results**: Boolean signals=`False`, numeric values=`0.0`
- **Sequential Processing**: Returns `None` to prevent further processing

### Logging Integration
- Clear warning messages for blocked operations
- Consistent logging format across all components
- Debug-level logging for development and troubleshooting

## 🔄 State Management

### System States
- **ON**: Normal operation, all signal generation active
- **OFF**: Emergency shutdown, all signal generation blocked
- **Transitions**: Graceful state handling during transitions

### Thread Safety
- Singleton pattern for kill switch access
- Consistent state checks across multiple calls
- Thread-safe access to controller state

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Processing Overhead
- **Minimal**: Single function call per signal generation method
- **Fast**: Direct boolean check with early return
- **Efficient**: No complex logic in hot paths

### Memory Usage
- **Low**: Empty DataFrames use minimal memory
- **Consistent**: Same structure maintained for downstream compatibility
- **Clean**: No memory leaks or resource holding when blocked

## 🛡️ Safety Features Implemented

### 1. **Multi-Level Protection**
- Event processing level (earliest possible block)
- Component processing level (business logic protection)
- Signal generation level (final safety net)

### 2. **Signal Structure Preservation**
- Empty signals maintain expected DataFrame structure
- Downstream components receive valid (empty) data
- No breaking changes to existing interfaces

### 3. **Comprehensive Logging**
- Clear indication when signals are blocked
- Consistent messaging across all components
- Debug support for troubleshooting

### 4. **State Consistency**
- Thread-safe access to system state
- Consistent behavior across all signal generators
- Graceful handling of state transitions
