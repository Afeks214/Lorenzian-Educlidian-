    sequence_length=48,  # 48 time periods for strategic
    overlap=12,
    max_memory_percent=75.0,
    checkpoint_frequency=100
)

# Initialize processor
processor = BatchProcessor(
    data_path="large_dataset.csv",
    config=batch_config,
    checkpoint_dir="checkpoints/"
)

# Process batches
for batch_result in processor.process_batches(strategic_trainer):
    print(f"Batch reward: {batch_result['metrics']['avg_reward']:.3f}")
```

### Tactical MAPPO Usage:
```python
# Configure for tactical training
tactical_config = BatchConfig(
    batch_size=64,
    sequence_length=60,  # 60 time steps for tactical
    overlap=15,
    max_memory_percent=80.0,
    checkpoint_frequency=200
)

# Process with tactical trainer
for batch_result in processor.process_batches(tactical_trainer):
    print(f"Processing time: {batch_result['batch_time']:.3f}s")
```
